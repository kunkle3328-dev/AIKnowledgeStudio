> **"Truth is not found in the void, but in the foundations of your data."**

AXIOM is a high-fidelity intelligence platform designed to transform raw, fragmented information into cohesive, grounded knowledge. Built on the cutting edge of the Gemini API, AXIOM serves as a "Grounded Intelligence Studio" where users can ingest multiple data sources and interact with them through cinematic audio overviews, multi-speaker podcasts, and real-time neural voice links.

## 🏛️ The Name: AXIOM

### **Etymology & Definition**
In logic and mathematics, an **Axiom** is a foundational truth—a starting point for reasoning that is accepted as self-evident without needing further proof. 

In the context of this platform, **your documents are the axioms**. Unlike general-purpose AI that hallucinates from the "void" of the internet, AXIOM treats your uploaded PDFs, web links, and transcripts as the fundamental truths from which all reasoning, summaries, and audio content are derived.

### **Pronunciation**
**AK-see-um**  
`/ˈæksiəm/`

## 🛰️ Core Features

### 1. Intelligence Vaults (Projects)
Organize your research into secure, semantic "Vaults." Each vault uses a classification engine to determine its category—Technology, Science, Business, or Research—and adapts its cinematic UI skin and iconography to match the subject matter.

### 2. Multi-Source Neural Ingestion
AXIOM supports a wide array of high-bandwidth inputs:
*   **Physical Uplink**: Upload PDFs and local documents.
*   **Web Ingestion**: Direct syncing with URLs and research papers.
*   **Multimedia Sync**: Deep integration with YouTube transcripts and audio files.
*   **Manual Buffer**: Direct text pasting for rapid intelligence gathering.

### 3. Grounded Intelligence Chat
Interact with your data using a specialized chat interface. Every response is strictly grounded in your provided sources, using the **Gemini 3 Pro** model for advanced reasoning. The interface uses a specialized "Markdown-Lite" renderer to ensure high readability with cinematic typography.

### 4. Audio Studio: Narrative Synthesis
The crown jewel of AXIOM. Transform dry documents into a professional, two-voice podcast.
*   **Dual-Voice Logic**: Features a "Host" (Kore) and an "Analyst" (Puck) who discuss your sources with human-like nuance.
*   **Personality Profiles**: Choose between *Neutral, Curious, Analytical, Warm,* or *Debate* modes to change the tone of the conversation.
*   **Chapterized Progress**: Automatically generates thematic chapters with precise timestamps.

### 5. Direct Neural Link (Gemini Live)
Engage in a low-latency, real-time voice conversation with your data vault. Powered by the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio** model, this feature allows you to "talk" to your documents with human-level speed and expressive synthesis, perfect for hands-free study or rapid brainstorming.

### 6. Cinematic UI/UX
Designed with a "Tech-Noir" aesthetic:
*   **Axiom Design System**: Custom typography using *Syncopate* and *Space Grotesk*.
*   **Dynamic Waveforms**: Real-time visualizers that react to audio intensity and AI "thinking" states.
*   **Metallic Shimmer Effects**: High-end UI transitions and shimmering text treatments for a premium, professional feel.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

*   **Frontend**: React 19, Tailwind CSS, Lucide-style iconography.
*   **AI Engine**: `@google/genai` (Google Gemini API).
*   **Models**:
    *   `gemini-3-pro-preview`: Advanced reasoning and chat.
    *   `gemini-3-flash-preview`: Rapid search grounding and summarization.
    *   `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`: Multi-speaker high-fidelity synthesis.
    *   `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025`: Real-time Live API interaction.
*   **Audio**: Web Audio API with raw PCM 16-bit decoding and smoothing algorithms.
